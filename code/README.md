# Technigo React Starter App

I have built this app with React using different components. It's an app in which you can register to start training martial arts. I combined my love for programming with my love for martial arts. I have used Javascript functions to make the functionality work. It's a multistep form so after answering the first question the user will be directed to the next one and so on.

I did face some problems in this project. I tried to implement a range slider from materials UI, which was harder than I expected. I will try to make it work as soon as possible. The slider is there but doesn't collect any data at the moment.

Here is the live link to my project:

# Survey form with React

This is a survey in which the user can aswer a few questions and get a summary of the chosen options. It's built with react using state and hooks. 

## The problem

I feel like the hardest part in this project was to implement a range slider from materials UI. That is still to do. Otherwise I had a hard time getting the radio buttons to work properly. As always I solved my problems by using google and stackoverflow and just inspect the code.
